The rapid growth of textual data and the increasing need for cross-lingual communication necessitate robust and efficient NLP solutions. This assignment explores the capabilities of Transformer-based models, T5 and mT5, which are highly effective for these tasks.\n",

        "*   The existing research content on T5, mT5, and BART models, including their key differences in model family, training objectives, use cases, tokenization, and practical notes, was confirmed to be adequate for the assignment.\n",
        "*   A synthetic dataset named `summarization_sample.csv` was successfully created, containing four entries with 'text' and corresponding 'summary' columns for T5 summarization fine-tuning.\n",
        "*   The T5 model (`t5-small`) was successfully fine-tuned for summarization after resolving initial `TrainingArguments` issues (specifically, removing `predict_with_generate` and `evaluation_strategy`). The fine-tuned model and tokenizer were saved to `./t5-summarization-final`.\n",
        "*   A synthetic English-Yoruba translation dataset, `eng_yoruba.csv`, was generated with 'source_text' and 'target_text' columns.\n",
        "*   The mT5 model (`google/mt5-small`) was successfully fine-tuned for English-Yoruba translation. This required debugging `TrainingArguments` to correctly set `eval_strategy=\"steps\"` and align `eval_steps` with `save_steps=100`. The fine-tuned model and tokenizer were saved to `./mt5-translation-final`.\n",
        "*   The fine-tuned mT5 translation model was evaluated, generating translations and calculating a BLEU score of 0.0. This low score was attributed to the extremely small and synthetic nature of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights and Next Steps\n",
        "*   **T5 Summarization Performance:** Despite fine-tuning on a very small, synthetic dataset, the T5 model demonstrated a reasonable ability to generate coherent and grammatically correct summaries, often extracting key information from the input text. This suggests the inherent strength of pre-trained T5 models for summarization tasks, even with limited task-specific fine-tuning data.\n",
        "*   **mT5 Translation Performance:** The mT5 model completely failed to produce meaningful translations, consistently outputting `<extra_id_0>` tokens or very generic, non-Yoruba phrases. This outright failure underscores the critical importance of sufficient and diverse training data, especially for low-resource language translation. The model likely overfit severely to the extremely limited and synthetic `eng_yoruba.csv` dataset, leading to an inability to generalize to new inputs.\n",
        "*   **Impact of Dataset Quality and Size:** Both tasks, but particularly multilingual machine translation, are highly sensitive to the size, quality, and diversity of the training data. Small, synthetic datasets like those used here are insufficient for building robust, generalizable models.\n",
        "*   **Recommendations for Future Work:**\n",
        "    1.  **Dataset Expansion:** The most critical next step is to acquire substantially larger, more diverse, and realistic datasets for both summarization and translation. For English-Yoruba translation, a comprehensive parallel corpus is essential to achieve any meaningful performance.\n",
        "    2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore more extensive hyperparameter tuning, potentially including different learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs, once a more suitable dataset is available.\n",
        "    3.  **Model Evaluation:** Implement more comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond BLEU (e.g., human evaluation, specific linguistic adequacy scores) for translation, and consider ROUGE scores for summarization, when working with larger, more diverse datasets."
